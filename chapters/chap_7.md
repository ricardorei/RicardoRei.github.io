# Syntax important Natural very Language is

> Text by: [Luísa Coheur](authors.md)

**Syntax** respects the way words can be organized in sentences. At this point,
I hope that it is clear in your mind that the syntax of any programming
language is much easier to capture than the one of any NL.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In NLP many people work in this research field. Some try to build
grammars or tools to parse sentences; others work on algorithms. In the
following we will remember some basic notions of syntax, we will study
some formalisms to code grammars, and we will see different algorithms
that perform syntactic analysis.

## Very brief review of the Portuguese syntax - back to school again

Different sentence types:

- Declarative: O CORPO DE JOAQUIM FOI DESCOBERTO NA MANHÃ SEGUINTE.
- Interrogative: QUEM PODERIA TER FEITO TAMANHA MALDADE? - interrogava-se uma vizinha.
- Imperative: MINHA SENHORA, SAIA-ME DAQUI! – a voz do inspector Morcela não deixava espaço para desobediências.
- Exclamatory: COITADINHO! – ainda comentou a senhora antes de desaparecer. Ia ser um dia difícil: tinha tanta coisas para contar às amigas.

Main constituents of a sentence:
- Subject: the entity (who or what) the sentence is about. Ex: O ALUNO fez o teste
- Predicate: what is said about the subject. Ex: O aluno FEZ O TESTE
- Direct Object: the receiver of the sentence action. Direct objects can be identified by asking: subject + verb + who? or what? = DIRECT OBJECT. Ex: O professor deu-lhe O TESTE
- Indirect Object: identifies to (or for whom or what) the sentence action is performed (transitive verbs). It typically precedes the direct object. An indirect object can be identified by asking who or what received the direct object. Ex: O professor deu-LHE o test
- Predicative (of the subject): gives sense to a verb, by adding features  to the subject. Ex: O professor anda contente da vida

Main phrases:
- Noun phrase: noun (or pronoun) + complements (optional). Ex: O JOÃO fugiu, AQUILO foi uma vergonha, A MAÇÃ VERDE E VENENOSA foi devorada pela Branca de Neve
- Verbal phrase: verb + complements (optional). Ex: Não COSTUMAMOS SAIR, COMECEI A LER o livro, TENHO DE SAIR hoje, Eu TENHO UMA BARBIE
- Adjectival phrase: adjective (or pronoun) + complements (optional). Ex: A rapariga MORENA fugiu, A aula é MARAVILHOSA
- Propositional phrase: preposition + noun + complements (optional). Ex: Fui a casa DO MEU AMIGO
- Adverbial phrase: Adverb + complements (optional). Ex: Foi um erro MUITO grande, FRANCAMENTE, não sei.

Agreement:
- Subject + Verb: Ex: O JOÃO FUGIU
- Verb + predicative of the subject: Ex: SÃO 10 HORAS
- Subject + predicative of the subject: Ex: O JOÃO estava CANSADO

## Formal Grammars

In this section you will see several formalisms for writing grammars. Some
(at least one) you already know about. However, it should be said that there
are many, many, many more formalisms.

### Context Free Grammars
You have probably already met a **CFG** before. A **CFG** is a tuple $$ (N, T,
S_0, R) $$, in which:

- $$ N $$ is a set of non-terminal symbols;
- $$ T $$ is a set of terminal symbols (either words or POS tags);
- $$ S_0 \in T $$ is the grammar's initial symbol;
- $$ R $$ is a set of rules in the form $$ A \to \alpha $$, where $$ A \in N $$ and $$ \alpha \in (N \cup T) $$

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fundamental concept behind **CFGs** is the one of derivation. A derivation
is a sequence of applications of grammar rules. In a derivation, a non
terminal symbol $$ A $$ can be replaced with a symbol $$ \alpha $$ if there is a rule $$ A \to \alpha $$.
Also, if after the application of several rules we manage to reach $$ \alpha_n $$ from
$$ \alpha_1 $$, we say that $$ \alpha_1 $$ derives $$ \alpha_n $$ (which is denoted by $$ \alpha_1 \to \alpha_n $$). A easy way
to represent a derivation is through an analysis or parse tree (see Figure bellow).

</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important concept associated with **CFG** (and grammars in general)
is the one of language generated by a grammar, which can be
defined as follows (where $$ L(G) $$ represents the language generated by the
grammar $$ G = (N, T, S_0, R) $$ ):

$$ L(G) = {W: S_0 \to_* W and W \in T^*} $$

As an example, consider the **CFG** $$G_1 = (N, T, S_0, R) $$, in which:
- $$ N = {F, SN, SV, NOM, V, DET} $$ &nbsp;
- $$ T = {a, Maria, sopa, come} $$ &nbsp;
- $$ S_0 = F $$ &nbsp;
- $$ R = {F \to SN|SV, SN \to DET|NOM, SV \to V|SN, DET \to a, NOM \to Maria|sopa, V \to come} $$ 

The sentence "A Maria come a sopa" belongs to $$ L(G_1) $$ and the Figure above, represents
its derivation.

**Exercise 24: CFG**

Create a CFG for the following fragment of Portuguese and show that each
sentence belongs to the grammar you have created by building the different
derivation trees:

```bash
Portugal é um país da Europa.
O Miguel come a sopa.
Todas as crianças gostam de batatas-fritas.
Todos os alunos fugiram pela janela.
```
