## Greetings!

> Text by: [Luísa Coheur](authors.md)

Hello and welcome to the Natural Language (NL) class, where you will learn how difficult to formalize and deal with natural languages are. You have probably learned to program in C, Java or Python, but during this semester you will understand that those are languages for babies. Do you think C syntax is complicated? Do you think that a compiler for Java is difficult to write? Please! Try to do it for Portuguese! 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, one of the major problems when dealing with NLs is that they are inherently ambiguous, contrary to formal languages that are designed to be unambiguous. Words are ambiguous, sentences are ambiguous, and even when we think they aren’t... well... they are. Really. Consider for example the sentence Read the book. If you say it referring to a book, it means that the book is worth to be read. However, if you say it about a movie, it is probably because the movie is bad. Scary, isn’t it? 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other major problem is variability. We can say the same thing in many different ways. That is, there is a panoply of ways of saying the same thing. In other words: we can verbalise something by using different words. Meaning that the same thing can be expressed by using different word sequences. Or... Hum... Got the idea?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is for free, nothing rules 100% of the time, and you will have to live with probabilities. Yes, I know, probably not your favourite class, but there is nothing I can do about it: we will have to cope with incertitude to survive. So a question arises: **are you sure you are ready?**

## What will we be talking about?

> Text by: [Luísa Coheur](authors.md)

Are you still there? If so, maybe you are brave enough to embrace this voyage through NLP. Anyway, I’m (almost) sure you will love it: there are tools for so many things, the set of applications is unlimited and you just need to have imagination and tenaciousness. You will learn how to play with the NLP cards and I’ll have the pleasure to teach you how to.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the following, I will briefly reveal you what you will learn during this class: First, we will survey the NLP area and its subdomains. We will talk about main research targets in NLP and respective challenges. We will talk about (devoted) people working in NLP and about some research centers. We will overview basic techniques and some of the more interesting applications. Then, we will study the basic ingredients of NLP, that is, we will learn about the basic concepts, methodologies and algorithms used in NLP. So, that’s it: welcome to NL courses and enjoy it (a lot)!
